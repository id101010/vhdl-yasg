YASG is yet another signal generator, written in vhdl. It uses Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) for signal generation. 
The hardware used will be a Xilinx Spartan-3AN eval board which brings a 12bit analog to digital converter. The boards rotary encoder is used as primary input (choosing signal form and frequency) and
the 16x2 LC-Display as optical output.
